It seems like every blog needs to start with an introduction, so here's mine.
I'm Brandon Mitchell, a currently semi-retired OSS developer.

My career started in consulting and contracting in the Enterprise Management space (think sysadmin but for large distributed networks using expensive software).
The second phase of the career shifted into the Docker container, cloud native, and DevSecOps ecosystems.
As time went on, I spend more of my free time maintaining open source software until I realized I was working two jobs, getting paid for one, while loving the other.
So for the time being, I'm making due without a paycheck, and enjoying giving back to the community that I owe so much of my career to.

In technology, my interests include:

- Open source and open standards
- Containerization (Docker and Kubernetes)
- OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications and tooling built around them
- Linux, mostly Debian
- Security, particularly supply chain security and reproducible builds
- Embedded systems and power efficiency

For fun, I tend to unplug, touch grass, and get out into nature.
That's often a bike ride for a day, or a backpacking trip for a weekend.
Going forward that will hopefully involve spending more time sailing and enjoying the open water.
